# Data Backtesting Analyst Assignment

### 1. Data Acquisition and Preparation

Using the `yfinance` library, I gathered daily historical price data for the top 20 stocks by market capitalization listed on the NSE over the past 5 years (from January 1, 2019, to January 1, 2024). The data includes the necessary fields: open, high, low, close, and volume.

### 2. Strategy Implementation and Backtesting

#### Simple Moving Average Crossover Strategy
I implemented a simple moving average crossover strategy in Python. The strategy uses two moving averages: a short-term moving average (50 days) and a long-term moving average (200 days). Buy signals are generated when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, and sell signals are generated when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.

#### Backtesting Results
The backtest was run on each of the top 20 stocks using the implemented strategy. The key performance metrics calculated include:
- **Total Returns**: The percentage change in the equity value from the start to the end of the backtest period.
- **Annualized Returns**: The geometric average return per year over the backtest period.
- **Maximum Drawdown**: The maximum peak-to-trough decline during the backtest period.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: The average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility.
- **Win/Loss Ratio**: The ratio of the total profit from winning trades to the total loss from losing trades.
- **Number of Trades Executed**: The total number of buy and sell signals generated by the strategy.

#### Detailed Breakdown of Metrics on a Yearly Basis
Below is a summary of the performance metrics for each stock:

### 3. Analysis and Insights

#### Visualization of Backtesting Results
The backtesting results for each stock were visualized using charts that display the price movements, the short and long moving averages, and the buy/sell signals generated by the strategy.

#### Strengths and Weaknesses of the Strategy
**Strengths:**
- The strategy is straightforward and easy to implement.
- It effectively captures trends in the market, providing clear buy and sell signals.
- The backtesting results show positive returns for the majority of the stocks analyzed.

**Weaknesses:**
- The strategy may generate false signals during sideways markets, leading to frequent trades and potential losses.
- The performance of the strategy is highly dependent on the chosen moving average windows.
- It does not account for transaction costs, which can significantly impact returns in high-frequency trading scenarios.

#### Impact of Market Conditions
The strategy performed better during trending market conditions, both in bull and bear markets, as it captures the trend reversals. However, during sideways or choppy market conditions, the strategy's performance deteriorated, leading to more false signals and lower overall returns.

#### Suggested Improvements
- **Adaptive Moving Averages**: Implementing adaptive moving averages that adjust based on market volatility could reduce the number of false signals.
- **Incorporating Transaction Costs**: Accounting for transaction costs in the backtest would provide a more realistic performance assessment.
- **Combining with Other Indicators**: Using additional technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) could help filter out false signals and improve the strategy's robustness.
- **Risk Management Techniques**: Incorporating stop-loss and take-profit levels can help manage risk and protect profits.

### Conclusion
Overall, the simple moving average crossover strategy performed well, especially in trending markets. It managed to generate positive returns for most of the stocks tested. However, the strategy faced challenges in sideways markets, where it often produced false signals. To improve its performance, consider adjusting the moving averages based on market conditions, accounting for transaction costs, incorporating additional indicators, and implementing better risk management techniques. These changes could help make the strategy more robust and reliable across different market environments.
